CONSTRAINTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanatory text)
- Be honest and direct: If business viability is low, reflect that in scores - don't inflate numbers
- Monetization assessment must be realistic: Consider what users actually pay for in this category
- Borg.tools fit should specifically address: MCP integration potential, AI workflows, developer tool alignment
- Market analysis must consider actual competitors, not hypothetical ones
- Don't recommend generic strategies: "build an MVP" isn't useful - specific go-to-market channels matter
- Pricing suggestions should reflect market realities: Research what similar tools charge
- Risk mitigation must be actionable: Concrete steps, not "monitor the market"
- Value proposition should be user-centric: What pain does this solve, not what features it has
- Growth potential should consider network effects: Single-player tools have different dynamics than platforms
